R3PO8G3B0O2PSS,Sharath,"It is just a review from my side so that its good for you to know before buying rather than regretting later.Positives:* Showoff* Camera* Sound* Security (they say, bt that blocks so many accessibility options for me)* So many awesome features as all iphone users say (which probably I will use once in a lifetime)Negatives for me (You may like it):1. No shortcut to change between vibration and no vibration frequently.2. No end cal button on the lock screen.3. Call list is nonsense. It shows phone, watsap and all other calls in same list.4. Goto a specific contact in call history n you can see only history of one day. Total length of call history is 100. Most probably you will not able to find call history of previous month for a specific contact.5. Need of Itunes to copy music from PC to phone.6. No file manager like android where we can see complete folder structure.7. No silent and vibrate mode notification on screen.8. Need to buy separate adapter n earphones after already spending double.9. Cannot remove torch icon in iphone14 frm lock screen. You may end up switching it on unwillingly.10. BT and WiFi shortcuts will just disconnect them. To turn off you need to go to Settings screen and turn it off again.11. In so many places, either text or files, there is no Select All option.12. Takes a lot of time to get detected by devices when hotspot is on.13. At some screen you get stuck and you will miss the back button.14. Copy some mp3 files to your iphone and you will never be able to find it with default music app.15. Every app will be either on lot of home screens or organised under some groups. You will never get a clean home screen with 2 or 3 most frequently used apps and all other apps in a swipe up menu like android.16. No fingerprint sensor.List goes on and on, try it yourself.. No iphone owner speaks about limitations. Some people like iphone for these and others hate it for these. If you can pay double and handle these adjustments with work arounds, go ahead.",6 June 2023,3,Midnight,128 GB
R3QN7WHCT1NEQA,Prasanna,"About the phoneApple phone without a second delay, I would say it is better than all android phones I have used. The phone is like water, it flows in a way you want and shaping in your way. In a best way possible, the phone is designed to only show what the user wants and eliminating unnecessary ads, features that I have seen in android.Why it is better than Android?You pay too much money for Apple products, obviously you experience the features, physical components , camera lens etc. Apart from basic things, you can also enjoy the best applications available in app store. If you are a developer you might know the app store policy for application publish and their security posture towards handling payment apps etc. They publish best application and the way the apps, its modules switches is just flawless. Due to the so called strict policy of privacy program with Apple products, iPhone can pop up a box in your screen if any apps wants to track your activity with other applications. +1 respect for apple to show such concern with user.Apple phones are same ? like 13 vs 14The reason 14 is same as 13 may be business practice followed from 11th edition. But please note that iPhone making changes internally like physical components (small change in battery performance, lens in 14 edition), additional features but that may not satisfy you to buy 14 edition. If you do not find ""the very few changes"" interesting in 14,  go for 13. Because physical and even cameras are not visually very much different in 13 vs 14 comparison. Also you get 13 for cheap :)14 is just added features but that is not for daily use, the features real time use is rare case. But the best part is there is no extra cost between 13 vs 14 prices (except extra 10k slash)Concern you must have.Apple is not giving chargers and their silicon cases are very expensive (but very good in touch and scratch friendly in back due to silk layer). This is an issue for sure. You have to buy charger not coming with USB C and claiming that you help carbon footprint, understandable but not customer friendly business model. Even after the purchase I had to spend at least 7k for charger and case.Apple care.I am not buying it, I pay for phone which is already expensive for this premium and apple care does have strict policy that if you understand that is waste. Instead I find a private insurance to make things better.",22 June 2023,5,Red,128 GB

RYJOV80T6QI8V,Anamitra Ghosh,"Pros:1. Powerful A15 Bionic chip2. Beautiful OLED display3. Excellent camera quality4. Long-lasting battery life5. Secure Face ID authentication6. Up to 5 years of software updatesCons:1. Expensive2. No major design changes from the iPhone 133. No headphone jack4. No expandable storageOverall, the iPhone 14 is a great phone, but it's not a major upgrade over the iPhone 13. If you're looking for a new iPhone, the iPhone 14 is a good option, but you may want to consider waiting for the iPhone 15, which is expected to have more significant changes.",3 June 2023,4,Purple,128 GB
RB0BO4DEM77O4,Sam,"I prefer to have some privacy in life, I think apple suite is bit more private than google. It respects user privacy if you are not using third party apps. My options were stock android without google (something like lineageOS) or iPhone. I tried lineageOS but there was always something breaking in my phone. It couldn't become my daily driver; I wish most of the things in android were open source like maps and some other proprietary google apps. In the current state, I was left with choosing iPhone. For long, I had debated with myself about buying iPhone or not, I was using OnePlus 7T for last 3.5 years. The phone stopped getting updates and had many bugs. The software changed a lot, I hated it. All these OEM betraying consumers made me switch to iPhone in the end. I can't trust any other brand to have the consistency like apple has. That's my take in the phone market. I wish there was a consistent bloat free android brand with a great camera.",27 June 2023,5,Midnight,128 GB

RX5FR6CUBJD11,SURAJ,"Using it as a daily driver.Have been an android users for the past 7 yrs, wanted to try something different in terms of OS. Had used windows also,This thing has grown upon me. It’s been just 20 days of the purchase and now I don’t feel switching back to android.The best part is the battery life. I can see a noticeable difference between Android and iPhone .

The increased storage capacity, which now stands at 128 GB, is one of the most significant improvements over its predecessor, providing ample space for storing photos, videos, and other important data.The Starlight color option is also visually appealing, with its soft, silvery hue lending a sleek and elegant appearance to the phone. The 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display on the phone is a visual treat, providing vivid and clear images whether you're browsing social media, watching videos, or playing games.The iPhone 14's powerful A18 chip, which delivers fast and efficient performance, is another standout feature.",10 May 2023,5,Starlight,128 GB

Only phone is fast enough to load them back quickly. You will notice only if you’rea heavy user. Screen is prone to scratches as it’s softer than gorilla glass.

R6OF97A2HYFUK,Rahul Kumar,"This is my first ever iPhone and before ordering I was very particular about it's colour and size. I wanted the midnight variant in the regular size. It looks so sleek in person. Yes it is glossy and a finger-print magnet but I'll have to bear with it coz I simply like black phones. It's working perfectly. Also, i would like to add, the packing of such an expensive device was not up to the mark. I have seen how well Apple packs the box and ships to its customers in videos of people from other countries. The Amazon seller just put it in a large plastic bag. Though the box was unharmed when it reached me, I could still notice a little dented corners on the box, which could have been avoided if they had packed the box in a bigger carton with foams.",21 May 2023,5,Midnight,128 GB

R2OWLJ7YP55LJ4,Gauravraj,"I have switched from Android to IPhone 14 (but i am not making my older phone an orphan, as i will still be using it!). But believe me.. Though iPhones are over premium smartphones, still, an iPhone is an iPhone. You can't resist using it.Phone is awesome, refresh rate is awesome and most important, camera... is Amazing..! One thing I really miss is fingerprint scanner. And the audio jack..(as i am not airpods friendly person). Silent slider is super!! E-sim is not new but still creative. I liked it.Coming to accessibility, for first few days or a couple of week, you will feel uncomfortable and inconvenience while finding few settings and applications as you are addicted to Android. Don't panic, be calm and use 'google' baba or youtube 'didi' to find ways to get particular settings yoh are searching for in iphone. There are ton's of video's on it. AND, don't be shy or ashamed of searching these things on google as no one is perfect or know everything beforehand.",10 May 2023,5,Midnight,128 GB
